# WordFinder
Find certain words inside the catalogue of certain artists/groups.

This is a program designed around the includes() and replace() functions. The program works by creating html divs from objects, with each song being an object.

The Program will take an input from the user and compare it to the texts of the songs. It will then mark the relevant text with spans and one can then click on the songs that came up and see the location of where the input matches the text.
