Yes sir  Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir  Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest  But all they got left is this guy called West  That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def  Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z  I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh  It come out sweeter than old Sadie  Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards  Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards  And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye  I'm almost Raymond  Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?  It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him  Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine  Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme  Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem  Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams  I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed  But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh  So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more  You niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more  You can't say shit to Kanye West no more  I rocked 20, 000 people, I was just on tour, nigga  I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don  Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom  I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards  I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars  I went to the malls and I balled too hard  'Oh my god, is that a black card?'  I turned around and replied, 'Why yes  But I prefer the term African American Express'  Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell  Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to  Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit  Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips  And I am  (Here's to the Roc)  And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them  (Here's to Roc-A-Fella)  Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and  (Here's to the Roc)  This is the last call for alcohol, for the  (Mr. Rockefeller)  So get your ass up off the wall  'Last call for alcohol, for my niggas'  So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the 'Truth' beat for Beanie.  And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do.  I play the songs, he's like 'Who that spittin?' I'm like 'It's me.'' He's like 'Oh, well okay.'  Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth  Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with  So won't you raise your glass won't you  So won't you raise your glass won't you  So won't you raise your glass won't you  So won't you raise your glass won't you  And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID.  And No ID told him, 'Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap'  No ID: 'Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap'  I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer  I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that 'Truth' beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then  I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, 'Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time.And really I just, like bit the drums off 'Xxplosive' and put it like with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'  And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, 'Oh you a real soulful dude.'  And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said  'Tell me what you think of this.' And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, 'What you think of it?'  And I was like, 'Man that shit tight, ' you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...  Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up  I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.' And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did 'Nothing Like It' already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, 'Yo play that one beat for him.' And I played 'Heart of the City.' And really I made 'Heart of the City, ' I really wanted to give that beat  To DMX  And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, 'Yo what's up I'm Kanye.'  'You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics'  You know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like 'oh shit.' And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, 'yo Jay I could rap.' And I spit this rap that said, uh 'I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.' And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response..."},

This is Larry Hoover Jr.  First and foremost, I wanna thank you for takin' the fight for my father to the Oval Office  You might not have been the only one that could've did that, but you were the one that did do that  And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight  You know to me it kinda feels like  Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids  Have all been incarcerated through this journey and we haven't even been to jail  We have been looked at, and treated as criminals, for bein' a part of this family  My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in  Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (tell me if you know someone that needs)  'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him  And it's what made the children of today  After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one  My father has not called any shots  From one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world  And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples  If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction  Into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years  Man, he would be dead to me  I didn't sign up for that  I didn't stay on this journey this long for that  All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home  They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home  Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home  I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home  Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated  He still not home  Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'  Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren  And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather  Even though it is not seen that way for some of us, but for many of us  Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community, who deserves to breathe free air  Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)"},

Sacrificed the ones you love  Gave up on your sanity  Like some twisted fantasy  What would I say to everything?  Your actions cost everything  My, my, my family  My family, I'm losing my family  I'm losing my family  Losing my family  Cried out to you in my sleep, you thought it was a dream  'Why won't you answer me? I'm in the room'  'Tell mom you're sorry,' she's screaming at me  'Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?'  'Come back tonight, daddy, please, come back tonight, daddy, please'  'Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?'  She don't know what this means, 'How'd you become so mean?'  I wish I never screamed, alcohol when you breathe  These things, these things, these things, these things, they sting  'Daddy, promise you'll stay, don't you love me? Love me'  Two lessons that he passed along to his children  The first -is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family  -Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family  -Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family  -Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family  -Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family  -Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family  -Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family  It is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is  He vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has"},
